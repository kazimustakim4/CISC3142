# BC Grade Rates Reporter

## Purpose

This program takes in a set of formatted input files (see input files section below) 
displaying course information and grades per student. The program then processes *all* the 
input files and creates a map of courses to student grades. These grades are then processed 
to show the rates of each type of grade per course information attribute based on the type 
of report chosen.


## How to Run this Program
Clone the repository with the recursive flag (the recursive flag is necessary in order to clone the data submodule): 

``git clone https://github.com/makmn1/CISC-3142-LABS --recursive``

If you forget to include the --recursive flag, you can update the cloned repository with the submodule by running: 

`git submodule update --init`

Next, move into the lab3 directory:

`cd lab3`

You can also add your own data files by following the [Input File Format](https://github.com/makmn1/CISC-3142-LABS/edit/main/lab3/README.md#input-file-format) section below.

Build the program using the provided Makefile by running: 

`make lab3`

After the program finishes building, it will automatically execute the program. 
You can execute the program again in the future by running: 

`./a.out`


## Report Generation
### Report Types
The following types of reports are available:

1. Rates by Instructor
